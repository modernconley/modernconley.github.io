Today I took advantage of the free content on Code School and spent HOURS and HOURS in classes. I completed [Adventures in Web Animations](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/adventures-in-web-animations). This class was great. It had a very interesting website and lots of different types of animations to learn in css. I learned all about adding color transitions, animating the position, rotation and scale of content. I also learned about the difference between PNG and SVG images and learned that SVG images allow each part of the vector based image to be stylized and animated using CSS code. 

After finishing the course (which took about two hours), I watched the accompanying webcast... [Soup to Bits Adventures in Web Animations](https://www.codeschool.com/screencasts/soup-to-bits-adventures-in-web-animations). The webcast gave an inside look at approaching a project from the beginning. The problem was to take the stylized website with three pages, given the HTML and CSS code, and add animations to make it more interesting. There were two people working as a team, solving problems aloud and on screen as isssue came up, and talking through their process. I really enjoyed watching this and learning how they took an idea and transformed it into an animation to add life to the website.

The webcast also gave links to additional resources that were used. These included: 
* [Animate CSS by Dan Eden](daneden.github.io/animate.css/) A repository of premade css animations.
* [Can I Use?](caniuse.com) A resource to determine what is/isn't supported by major browsers
* [Pleeease](pleeease.io/play/) An automation to add prefixes to the css code
* [Code Pen](codepen.io) A plethora of html css and js projects to explore and learn from 

I am always glad to have addtional resources to use as I learn.
