Today I started working through the problems at [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net). I'm using Python to complete the assignments because that's the
language I've been using with udacity's Intro to CS course. 

I solved the first two problems. I got stuck on problem three with a MemoryError. I was trying to create a long list of factors
and then wanted to sort through the list to find the largest prime. It worked for small numbers. But this apparently is way too expensive of a way to approach
the problem so I'll need to think of another method.
