One of the tools that is currently listed as a vital piece to understand is Git. Git is a version control management system. GitHub is a web-based service that provides free accounts to host open source software projects. [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) allows you to create free websites, one per GitHub account, and an unlimited number per project. 

I decided that building this blog here would be a practical way to get comfortable with Git and GitHub. It also is a way to practice Markdown and Jekyll. Markdown is way to add formatting to the blog, it is like an HTML and CSS shortcut. Jekyll is included with GitHub Pages and it is a way to create static sites from dynamic content (a blog).

I learned most of this via googling, and I set up this blog following [this step-by-step tutorial by Jonathan McGlone](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/). This tutorial is why I love learning things online. I love that people compile their knowledge and experience, and then condense it in an easy to use tutorial. 

So far I've been using the web interface at GitHub to draft and publish and edit this blog. My goal is to move my files locally and use the Git interface to publish them instead. This will give me some initial practice with Git and the command line and version control. It will also allow me to write a bunch of drafts of blog posts and then publish them when they are finished.

There's a [list of blogs that use Jekyll on GitHub](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/wiki/Sites). I am learning a lot by clicking through and looking at the index.html source files of other blogs created in the same way. I haven't decided how I want this blog to be structured, so I'll keep looking for inspiration.
