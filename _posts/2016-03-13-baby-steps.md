I installed [Atom for ubuntu](https://atom.io/) to facilitate easier editing of the code for [my first project](/2016/03/08/Project1). 

I signed up for an account on [Freelancer](https://www.freelancer.com/). I can submit eight bids a month for free (i.e., without having a paid premium account). I am sticking with the free account until I spend more time on this site. I can not tell how many of the projects are legitimate, and I have found many that appear to be spam/phishing. 

To continue learning web dev skills, I started Udacity's [Intro to HTML and CSS course](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-html-and-css--ud304). This course is very much like all the other courses, but I think it has better projects/challenges. I'm looking for courses that go beyond the basic.

I also started the [PHP course on codeacademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/php). This course is so lame. Why do all these courses start in the same place? There are plenty of Intro to programming classes that expalin in detail things like strings, variables, if/then, for/else loops, etc. A PHP course should a) explain what PHP is and where it is used b) start with the particular syntax for PHP c) give examples of real life applications of using PHP. The codeacademy course fails on all three points. I am 80% through the class and so far the most complex example has assigned a number to a variable and used that number to print text in the html. This can not be the point of PHP. Will the last 20% of the course be of value? I will find out!
