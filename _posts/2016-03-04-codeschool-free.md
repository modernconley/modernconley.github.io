This weekend [Code School](codeschool.com) offers all of their content for free. I used codeschool once before this, to complete their free class [Try Git](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-git).
I looked through the available courses and bookmarked some that interested me. Then I started [Rails for Zombies Redux](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/rails-for-zombies-redux/goto). I realized this course is always free, so I decided to look for other content that would normally be paid. I then switched to [Flying Through Python](http://campus.codeschool.com/courses/flying-through-python). As I already have been using Python, I started at Lesson 3, and completed lessons 3-5. I really like the format of codeschool. They have catchy animated intros with songs. They include interesting problem sets. Their code simulators work really well to check your work and to give you hints.
