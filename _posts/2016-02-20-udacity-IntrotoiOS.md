I started another udacity course called [Intro to iOS App Development](https://www.udacity.com/courses/ud585). Although I like the format of the class, the content moves extremely slow. 
I finished lessons 1 to 3a. Udacity appears to be redoing much of this course and it's hard to know how much of what is shown is for the current version of Switft. 
I am following along, taking notes, googling things, and answering the quizzes. I am working on a PC, so I'm not actually creating an app in Swift as I go. Making the app at the same time would be the best way to get the full value out of this course. I've decided to stop taking this course, and continue with it at some point in the future.
