This week I have been working on lesson 6 of udacity's CS101 course ([Intro to Computer Science](https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-cs101)). I feel pretty confident 
with the programming exercises. Sometimes the quizzes are overly tricky. I've never been a fan of tricky quizzes. But
as long as I can keep answering the exercises I think I'm doing ok. 

I've also started udacity's [Intro to iOS App Development with Swift](https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud585). I'm at the beginning of lesson two. I have
not set up swift on a mac yet, because the newer mac laptop is what my husband uses for work, so I need to borrow his
until I purchase my own.
