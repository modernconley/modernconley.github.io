This week I spent a lot of time reading about Udacity's [NanodegreePlus](https://www.udacity.com/nanodegree) program. This is a new offer from Udacity which combines their nanodegree with career guidance. They offer to refund your tuition costs if you are unable to find a job (within reason). Although Udacity offers many different Nanodegrees, they only offer the guarantee with four of them. I am interested in two of them: the iOS Developer and the Machine Learning Engineer. The iOS Developer is something that I can comprehend in my daily life as I'm surrounded by iOS devices. The Machine Learning speaks to my inner mathematician. I hope to decide which direction to go in within the next two weeks.

I picked up where I was in the [Intro to Computer Science Class](https://www.udacity.com/courses/cs101). I'm about halfway through the 5th lesson, and there are seven in total.

I did some local searching for personal connections and new meetup groups. As I'm not entirely sure what direction by study is going in, it has been difficult to commit to a single group.

I finished the [Git tutorial](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-git) at code school, and am partly through [Git Immersion](http://gitimmersion.com/). I started this blog you are currently reading using Github. I started fiddling with git using the Terminal.
