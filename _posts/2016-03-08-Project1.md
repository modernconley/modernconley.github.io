I resumed work on my first project. I am coding a website from scratch. I am using an HTML and CSS walkthrough to get the basic structure. I am writing the files in a text editor and then previewing them in Chrome. The tutorial is [here](http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/).
I have drafted the index page and three additional pages for content. And I have the basic structure of the CSS document. I have about three more steps of the [shayhowe tutorial](http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/) to complete, and then I will spend a lot of time filling out the content and making adjustments.
