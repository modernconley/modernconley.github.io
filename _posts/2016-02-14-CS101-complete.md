title: "I completed Udacity's CS101 course"

This week I finished up Lesson 6 and 7 of the CS101 course on Udacity. Lesson 7 is the final lesson in the course and contains a short review of the course content plus several interviews with computer scientists in a "field trip" format. The information about quantum computing was pretty fascinating. A qubit is a like a bit but can have another state between on and off.

A set of Cumulative Practice Problems appears after lesson 7. I attempted and solved four of these (1, 2, 5, and 6) out of nine total. There is also a long project that I might work on at some point, but I'm anxious to get going on some of the other udacity content.

I returned my focus to the Intro to iOS App Development with Swift course, and finished lesson 2. I don't love the format of this one. The pace seems slower. The videos are shorter and there are more quizzes that require you to google for answers. I'm a long-time self-motivated learner. I don't really need the prompts to help me "think through" and "find" the information. I have plenty of real experience with those skills. I understand why these prompts exist though. There are plenty of people who don't have the skills to use documentation and think through where and how to find answers. The Swift software appears really complex, so I'm sure there is a reason why the pace is slow, especially at the beginning.
