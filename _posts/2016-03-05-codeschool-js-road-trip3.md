Today I started another codeschool class called [JavaScript Road Trip Part 3](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/javascript-road-trip-part-3). This is an intermediate JavaScript class in which students will "Master function expressions, closures, hoisting, objects, and the use of prototypes."

I completed the first three levels of the class, which is 52% completed. The challenges were difficult but I was able to solve most of them. I'm going to attempt to finish the class completely tomorrow, but not sure if I'll be able to have enough time. The free weekend of codeschool has convinced me that their classes are worth paying for. The classes are well designed, the lectures are interesting, the feel of the website is that of high-quality, and the challenges are difficult but not impossible.
