I started a new course in order to try out the EdX course offerings. I'm taking [Introduction to Programming with Java, IT.1.1x](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:UC3Mx+IT.1.1x+3T2015/info).
I completed Week 0 and Week 1. I scored 19/20 on Exam 1. 
I enjoy listening to the professor in this course from Universidad Carlos III de Madrid. The videos have a 1.5x and 2x speed option, as well as the transcription highlighted next to the video. This format is great and makes it easy for me to soak up the information.
I found the content to be fairly straightforward. I mistakenly thought that this course would be an Introduction to Java. But it is an Introduction to Programming using Java. So far we have used/seen a miniscule amount of Java. 
Why do all programming courses start with an introduction to variables?!?
