Although I've just started this blog, I started this journey six months ago. In August I decided to slowly start learning about coding opportunities. In this post I will detail the steps that led me to writing this blog.

I started with [the Bento Grid](https://www.bento.io/grid), a highly organized and systematic approach to learning the full stack of web development skills. During August and September of 2015 I completed the recommended lessons for six of the first nine skills. Namely: fundamentals, html, css, shell, javascript, and python. 

Studying javascript led me to the very interactive courses at [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/). Even though it is not geared towards professionals, the community feedback of the projects is valuable (and free). I completed the Intro to JS and Games & Visualizations courses. I would like to go back to finish the Advanced JS course as it focuses on Natural Simulations.

Through the [python box](https://www.bento.io/python) I found [udacity](https://www.udacity.com/) as I started their [Intro to Computer Science Course](https://www.udacity.com/courses/cs101). The content at udacity is very high quality and the level of quizzes and challenges is both well-paced and challenging. The course work is available for free but there appear to be many benefits of paying for their services. As I worked through about half of this course I also looked at the OpenCourseWare class offered by MIT called [Intro to Electrical Engineering and Computer Science](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-01sc-introduction-to-electrical-engineering-and-computer-science-i-spring-2011/). The entire library of lectures and coursework is availble for free through MIT, but it is very dense.

In September I applied to a graduate certificate program at Regis University. The College of Computer and Information Sciences was offering graduate certificates. I applied and was accepted to study [Software Engineering](http://www.regis.edu/CCIS/Academics/Degrees-Programs/Certificates/GC-in-Software-Engineering.aspx). I chose Regis because my husband is employed as a professor there. We were under the impression that as his spouse I could attend for free. Unfortunately I had to drop out of the program before even beginning. We were told that as a spouse I was only eligible to take undergraduate courses. As I already hold both BS and MS degrees, I only wanted to pursue the graduate certificate. 

The holidays, illness, and a death in the family occupied most of November and December. I sorted through my goals and expectations and disapointment about not attending Regis. 

This month, January 2016, I have rededicated myself to self-paced and self-directed learning. The next box in the Bento Grid is Git. In learning about Git I learned about using GitHub Pages for a free blog. That prompted me to start this blog and make an effort to track my progress in writing.
